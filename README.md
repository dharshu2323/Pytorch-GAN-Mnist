# Pytorch-GAN-Mnist


This code implements a GAN for generating MNIST-like images. The generator takes random noise as input and generates synthetic images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake images. The generator and discriminator are trained alternatively, and the generated images are saved at the end of each epoch.
